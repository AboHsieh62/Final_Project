This is our take on the mine sweeper game. 

## How To Use
Run main.py file

## How to play
### Know your symbols
* Flag: Put a flag in a zone when you have confirmed that there is a mine.
* Question Mark: Put a question mark when you suspect that there is a mine. But it is useless.
* Smiley face: Click it if you want to reset the game.

### Clicking stuff
You can start by clicking at any random place. Chances are you'll have something like the image. The number is the number of mines adjacent to the block. So let's take the case in the image. See the bottom-left block in the image (3rd from the left and 2nd from bottom). It has 1 mine adjacent to it and there is only one unopened block next to it. Therefore, it must be a mine. Flag it by right clicking. Yay! Now you've found your first mine. Do the same with others. If a block with 2 has only two unopened mines flag the unopened ones and same for other numbers.

## Code description
1. main.py : This is the main function of the mine sweeper game.
2. objects.py : This code file contains all the objects and algorithms necessary to run the game.
